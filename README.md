# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
    - [Sponsor](#sponsor)
    - [Adding new features or fixing bugs](#adding-new-features-or-fixing-bugs)
- [License](#license)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

*You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working.

Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration.
